Leo Meyerovich is the founder & CEO of Graphistry, the first GPU-accelerated visual graph intelligence platform. Federal, enterprise, science, and tech teams use Graphistry on problems like threat hunting, anti-fraud, and cancer genomics. Leo's past research at UC Berkeley (PhD) and Brown (ScB) in high performance computing, security, and programming language design received the SIGPLAN 10 Year Test of Time award, multiple best paper awards, and is published in CACM, Security & Privacy, WWW, and others. Several of the ideas are now common in browsers (parallelization), web frameworks (functional reactivity), and cloud infrastructure providers (security verification). As part of Graphistry, he helped start the GPU dataframe ecosystem, the initial Apache Arrow implementation, and the medical anti-misinformation open AI effort Project Domino.
