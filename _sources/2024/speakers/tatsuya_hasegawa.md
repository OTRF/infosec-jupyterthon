| Title | Abstract | Date | Time |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Comparison of collaboration methods between MSTICpy and Splunk SIEM | Method 1 is simply to use msticpy's Query Provider and Uploader. Method 2 is to use Splunk DSDL App for data transfering to Jupyter, and msticpy for only analysis. There are advantages and disadvantages in case by case. On the other hand, We have no worry about the choice in MS Sentinel which has the highly compatible method by using "Microsoft Sentinel ML Notebooks". Audiences can take away about Splunk DSDL mechanism and the pros/cons for these Methods. | 2024-02-15 | 19:30 |
