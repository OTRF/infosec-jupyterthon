| Hacking Proprietary Protocols with Pandas | Proprietary protocols are typically a mystery to many practitioners. Vendors across many industries develop them for very specific purposes and technologies. We see them in everything from the Internet of Things (IOT), to Industrial Controls Systems (ICS), to medical devices and more. Since there is generally no public Request for Comments (RFC) or public disclosure on how they work, they present an opportunity for attackers and a challenge for defenders. In this presentation, Ismael Valenzuela, will present how defenders can tackle these unknown protocols to detect or flag unusual behavior in this traffic, using Jupyter notebooks and Python libraries like pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib, for data exploration and visualization. | 2024-02-15 | 17:30 |
