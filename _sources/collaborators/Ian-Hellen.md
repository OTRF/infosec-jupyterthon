Ian works as a software developer in the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). He spends most of his time building and maintaining MSTICPy - our CyberSec hunting Python tool library - and creating Jupyter notebooks for threat hunting and investigations. Prior to this, Ian worked on Azure Security Center (now Defender for Azure), security assessments for Microsoft services and multiple security reviews/pen tests of Windows (as far back as Vista!). In his spare time, Ian loves skiing, snorkeling & scuba, music and occasional messing around with Raspberry PIs and micropython devices.
