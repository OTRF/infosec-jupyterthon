Chi Nguyen is a Product Manager in the Microsoft Sentinel product group. She currently focuses on a few core Threat Hunting feature areas including Jupyter Notebooks integrations, data summarization for high query performance on large data sets, and federated search on external data.
Chi has been involved in different Jupyter InfoSec communities both internal and external and hope to be able to connect to 
and learn from many of other Jupyter enthusiasts.
