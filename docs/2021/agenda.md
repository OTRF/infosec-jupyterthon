|1:00pm-1:35pm|<b>Using Jupyter Notebooks to Solve A Variety of Business Problems</b><br><br>Notebooks are a powerful tool — we all love simplifying the gap between research, presentation, and delivery of results, right? However, the best way to use notebooks is often different depending on the end consumer of the information you’re providing. For example, notebooks can be a place to quickly iterate on research and create a proof of concept, or they can enable data consumption and analysis for a non-technical user group. Using notebooks effectively can have a positive impact on your business. But how do different groups achieve that impact? During this talk, I’ll take you through some examples of how we’ve used notebooks to support different business needs at Expel. We’ll talk about the problems we solved, the tools we used to do it, and how notebooks helped us make the results understandable — and most importantly, accessible — to our teams, including non-technical users.<br><br>Elisabeth Weber, Principal Data Scientist, Expel<br>|
|1:35pm-2:05pm|<b>How MSTIC uses Notebooks to Analyze Threat Signals</b><br><br>An overview of how MSTIC created a platform upon which analysts can use Jupyter NBs to collect & process threat signals at-scale.<br><br>Neal Shenk, Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst, Microsoft<br>Sil Han, Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst, Microsoft<br>Natanela Brod, Software Engineer II, Microsoft<br>|
|2:15pm-2:50pm|<b>Incident response notebooks - Log Análisis</b><br><br>Log analysis is a big problem in incident response.  It is common for an incident to have to analyze gigabytes of events, usually in unhelpful formats. During the presentation, a proposal for the parsing, filtering and analysis of these events will be shown.  In the same way, it will talk about the limitations of pandas for the analysis of large amounts of data and how these situations can be handled. This presentation is directly applicable to incident response but the techniques described can be used in any field of data analysis.<br><br>Luis F Monge, Forensic analyst and incident handler, Telefónica<br>|
|2:15pm-2:50pm|<b>Reason Cyber Campaigns With Kestrel</b><br><br>Is there any evidence of these IOCs on my systems? From the context, are they false positives? Are these IOCs part of a larger campaign? Do you frequently search for TTPs, manually walk process trees to identify the root cause, or backtrack an attack across systems on your network? Cyber reasoning is the abstraction behind all the above questions: like clearing the "fog of war" in a real-time strategy game, security analysts implement a reasoning step, execute it to clear a small piece of "fog" ahead, reevaluate the entire visible region, and plan for the next reasoning step to iterate. Analysts may enumerate well-known reasoning steps, encode the latest knowledge into never-seen steps, and probe in multiple directions to develop reasoning strategies for different clients regarding their security measures and gaps. The Kestrel Threat Hunting Language enables comprehensive reasoning by minimizing distractions from low-level incompatible data and operations. In this session, we will perform step-by-step reasoning using Kestrel on Jupyter Notebook. To discover an APT campaign reproduced in our red lab, we will match TTP patterns, pivot around endpoint entities like processes, files, and network traffic, apply analytic steps including context enrichment and visualization, and backtrack the cyber campaign across devices and networks. Join our hunters game at InfoSec Jupyterthon 2021 to reason cyber campaigns with Kestrel. https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang<br><br>Xiaokui Shu, Research Staff Member, IBM<br>|
|3:40pm-4:15pm|<b>Moonwalking - Deriving Audit policy's from EventID's</b><br><br>I will show walk users through connecting to an Elastic cluster, running queries that will give them an idea of what their audit policy looks like based on the EventID's. I will also walk them through matching the events they have to possible rules that would fire in the Elastic SIEM. When you have logs, but don't know what's in them...I'll show users how to enumerate the logs and understand the fields/values that are important.<br><br>Neil Desai, Principal Security Strategist, Elastic<br>|
|4:15pm-4:50pm|<b>Threat Hunting at scale with Spark Notebooks</b><br><br>Jupyter notebooks already plays key role in threat hunting and automating blue team workflows. In most of the use cases, data being worked on is relatively small and can be manipulated effectively with computes attached to Jupyter notebooks but  in some cases, analysts have to perform threat hunting or reactive investigation on historical logs ranging from 14 days to 30 days or sometimes even more on voluminous data sources such as network firewall logs. Loading such large datasets and working with such large dataframes can be challenging with the limited compute and memory resources , in such cases we need to look at alternative solutions to handle such data at scale. In this presentation, we will look at native python libraries available to manipulate large dataframes as well as look at handling it via notebooks attached to Apache Spark pools. We will showcase notebook demonstrating various use cases where Apache Spark can help in performing distributed processing of large dataframes, performs complex data manipulation operations to find anomalous stuff , perform data engineering on raw datasets and explore Spark ML libraries to perform threat hunting at scale.<br><br>Ashwin Patil, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft<br>|
|4:50pm-5:30pm|<b>GPU-era Hunting of MBs/GBs/TBs- Graph Visualization & Wrangling</b><br><br>Leo Meyerovich is the founder & CEO of Graphistry, the first GPU-accelerated visual graph intelligence platform. Federal, enterprise, science, and tech teams use Graphistry on problems like threat hunting, anti-fraud, and cancer genomics. Leo's past research at UC Berkeley (PhD) and Brown (ScB) in high performance computing, security, and programming language design received the SIGPLAN 10 Year Test of Time award, multiple best paper awards, and is published in CACM, Security & Privacy, WWW, and others. Several of the ideas are now common in browsers (parallelization), web frameworks (functional reactivity), and cloud infrastructure providers (security verification). As part of Graphistry, he helped start the GPU dataframe ecosystem, the initial Apache Arrow implementation, and the medical anti-misinformation open AI effort Project Domino.<br><br>Leo Meyerovich, CEO & Founder, Graphistry<br>|
