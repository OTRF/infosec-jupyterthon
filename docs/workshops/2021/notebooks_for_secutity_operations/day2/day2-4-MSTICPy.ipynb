    "You can use pip to install packages via the command line, or if you are using a notebook, directly in a notebook cell. Azure ML compute come with Pip installed already but if you are running your notebook elsewhere you may need to install pip first.\n",
    "\n",

    "MSTICPy is always open to contributions from the community, whether this be fixes to the current code base, feature additions, or just new ideas and suggestions.\n",

    "To help people with this we are running a Community Sprint during January 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this sprint we are encouraging people to engage with and contribute to MSTICPy. Contributions can take any form but in order to make this as easy as possible for people we will be offering support and guidance during the month to help people work out where and how to contribute.\n",
    "We will provide:\n",
    "- A set of contribution ideas tailored to differing skill levels and time commitments\n",
    "- Office Hours where you can come and ask questions and get help from the MSTICPy team\n",
    "- Additional contribution resources and guidance\n",
    "- Some awesome swag for people who contribute\n",
