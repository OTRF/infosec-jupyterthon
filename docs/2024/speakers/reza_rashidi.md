| Title | Abstract | Date | Time |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Enable Vulnerabilities with Audit Vulnerabilities | Organizations must recognize that even vulnerabilities with lower severity ratings can be critical in a chain of attacks. Adversaries often use a combination of low and medium severity vulnerabilities to create a pathway for more significant exploits. Therefore, it's essential to address these vulnerabilities promptly and incorporate them into regular security training and adversary simulation exercises. By simulating attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities, organizations can better understand potential attack vectors and strengthen their defenses accordingly. This proactive approach is key to maintaining robust security in an ever-evolving threat landscape. | 2024-02-16 | 13:45 |
