I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional based in Barcelona, always eager to explore new approaches. Started my journey in offensive security, and now I'm focused on developing cutting-edge preventive and detection tools based on User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) at i2Cat. Additionally, I'm deeply involved in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and have created a tool called InfoHound for domain/organization profiling.
