| Threat Hunting in Three Dimensions | Threat hunting often demands capabilities beyond the scope of traditional SIEM platforms. This presentation showcases a threat hunting workflow that leverages Jupyter for rapid, iterative, and visual analysis of complex data. By tapping into humans' innate understanding of three dimensions, we will demonstrate how to calculate and re-calculate metrics and distances between data points. Specifically, we focus on comparing attributes of Google Chrome Extensions for similarity in Euclidean space, allowing interactive exploration of data and a deeper understanding of relationships between data points. This approach helps uncover instances of masquerading within the extensions. | 2024-02-15 | 17:10 |
