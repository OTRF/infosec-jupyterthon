| Cybersecurity: Data, the Seeds of Chaos | This talk is about our recently published book (the third one) "Cybersecurity: Data, the Seeds of Chaos". The objective is to present to the audience the five open-source projects that are included in each chapter of the book. Some of the projects that are going to be presented are a chatbot for gathering information from OSINT tools, an example of prompt hacking, and an adversarial machine-learning model for ransomware. All the projects were developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook and can be found in the next URL https://github.com/i2tResearch/Ciberseguridad_web. The book is free and can be found here https://www.icesi.edu.co/editorial/ciberseguridad-datos-caos/ | 2024-02-16 | 14:20 |
