1) Using ChatGPT with notable.io to walk through creating a notebook
2) Using Jupyter Notebook all the way through on an incident, from incident summary to printing out the final report.  Ideally, MDE but Sentinel seems to be the more popular way to do this. 
3) Is there a way to print or save the results from my notebook investigation to upload to a SOAR OR incident ticket? 
And thank you so much for doing this!!! "
