  YETI is an open source threat intelligence platform storing data in a graph database.
  It implements a REST API giving access to all stored data which can then be reused in your hunting notebook to then build nice visualisation graph.
  This short presentation will demo what's possible to achieve with Yeti in a notebook and highlight some nice Python libraries to play with graph data.
