  Throughout the past few years, Jupyter has become a popular tool within the security community because it can easily be used by others to leverage different capabilities. Notebooks are shareable and reusable, and they improve collaboration and workflow. There are many use cases available, and for sure, there is one for you.
  In this talk, I want to offer the community the key to start or improve their journey with notebooks. Welcome to the Jupyter Universe!
