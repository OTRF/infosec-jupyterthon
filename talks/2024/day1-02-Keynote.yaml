abstract: >-
  This talk is a retrospective on how my organization grew a community of notebook users across DFIR, SecOps, and detection engineering teams and how notebooks became core to our workflows.
  We will share some of the challenges when trying to convince an organization to adopt Jupyter notebooks and the paved roads that were helpful to support the range of use-cases.
  Lastly, we will evaluate the positive and negative impacts from operationalizing notebooks at scale.
