  In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the ability to prototype and deploy effective tools swiftly has become increasingly important. Thit talk will delve into the power of Streamlit, a versatile Python framework, in accelerating the development of data-driven security tools and prototypes.
  Streamlit offers a streamlined approach to building interactive web applications without the complexities often associated with traditional development methods. In this session, we will explore how Streamlit differs from conventional tools like Jupyter Notebook, highlighting its advantages in terms of speed and usability.
  The core of the discussion will revolve around leveraging Streamlit to rapidly set up data-driven tools for Security Operations Centers (SOC). We will delve into practical use cases where Streamlit can be employed to enhance SOC operations, from visualizing real-time threat intelligence to simplifying incident response workflows.
  To provide a holistic understanding of Streamlit's capabilities, we will conclude the talk with an end-to-end practical use case related to security. This case study will illustrate how to conceptualize, design, and deploy a security tool using Streamlit, offering attendees actionable insights that they can immediately apply to their security projects.
