    bio: >-
      Leo Meyerovich is the founder & CEO of Graphistry, the first GPU-accelerated visual graph intelligence platform.
      Federal, enterprise, science, and tech teams use Graphistry on problems like threat hunting, anti-fraud, and cancer genomics.
      Leo's past research at UC Berkeley (PhD) and Brown (ScB) in high performance computing, security, and programming language design received the SIGPLAN 10 Year Test of Time award, multiple best paper awards, and is published in CACM, Security & Privacy, WWW, and others.
      Several of the ideas are now common in browsers (parallelization), web frameworks (functional reactivity), and cloud infrastructure providers (security verification).
      As part of Graphistry, he helped start the GPU dataframe ecosystem, the initial Apache Arrow implementation, and the medical anti-misinformation open AI effort Project Domino.

  To predict the generative AI future of notebooks and Python in the SOC and for security operations in general, this talk first looks into the past.
  Project Jupyter is celebrating its first decade, and their success with Jupyter Notebooks has been an inspiring journey in helping teams more easily adopt automation, GPUs, data science, and open source.
  With many teams facing priorities like security data lakes, SOAR automation, threat hunting visibility & IR playbooks, better detection engineering, and overall "do more with less", incorporating Python-powered methodologies has become an even more important enabler.
  However, the effectiveness of notebooks in the SOC - and Python in general - has all too often been limited to a limited number of code-centric teams and a frustratingly small number of workflows within a deployment.
  This talk explores the challenges we've experienced in the field, and connects them to what is happening in generative AI and how tools like http://Louie.AI are prompting a reassessment of foundational assumptions in how we use Python.
  Focusing on field stories and live demos, the talk should give a concrete view of the new emerging era for Python and notebooks  in security operations.
