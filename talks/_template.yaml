  An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks to kick off the main event! We are going to talk about the basics of notebooks, architecture, and how to deploy your own at home and even use open infrastructure to deploy one in the cloud and access it through your favorite browser.
  In addition, we are going to go over a few ways to connect to a few popular SIEMs such as ELK, splunk and Azure Sentinel from a notebook and return a dataframe to perfom additional analysis.
