  You can derive value from threat intelligence in a number of ways, including a complete threat intelligence platform, ingesting threat feeds, or simply leveraging threat intelligence capabilities found in popular security tools.
  One less common way to leverage threat intelligence is by sharing practical information with others.
  Sharing the methods of analysis and derived conclusions is of value for the infosec community as it demonstrates a practical and reproducible procedure.
  Notebooks are all about sharing tools and workflow, they provide a perfect way to exchange knowledge and to improve the capabilities of your team.
  Share your hunting and defense techniques - the more you share, the harder it is for bad guys.
