  The lingua franca for working with modern AI is embeddings, which are low-dimensional representations of data that are used to make many AI tasks fast, easy, and composable.
  Especially effective in problems like cybersecurity and fraud log data, UMAP (universal manifold approximation and project) tools can automatically generate high-quality embeddings.
  This session looks at the problem of alert fatigue and shows how to treat alert tasks like grouping, visualization, outlier detection, and prioritization as embedding problems.
  While this may sound complicated, we will show, with modern tools like Pandas and the PyData ecosystem, working with embeddings can be quite simple yet powerful.
  We will walk through:
  - What an embedding is and where UMAP fits in the historical timeline
  - How to quickly run UMAP on any event or entity data, including examples from our own investigations in areas like anti-fraud, human trafficking, alerts, and tickets
  - Automatically visualizing UMAP - and going well beyond the typical scatterplot!
  - Quickly improve embeddings through automatic feature engineering and supervision
  - Some of our favorite parameters
  - Using the embedding for tasks like visually summarizing the day's incidents, bucketing alerts into prioritized incident groups,  automatically finding related incidents, and detecting outliers
  - Emerging patterns for how to go from notebook experiments to embedding into team tools & pipelines
  The notebook and workflow will use free OSS tools (Pandas, umap_learn/cuML, PyGraphistry[AI]) on free data. For participants with access to GPU notebooks, the workflow can also run on GPUs, and CPU-only will work too.
