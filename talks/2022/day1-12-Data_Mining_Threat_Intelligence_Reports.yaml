  There is an ever-increasing set of threat intelligence reports produced by an ever wider number of providers.
  Keeping up with these reports can be a full-time job - understanding the value they provide, extracting the relevant elements and applying those to the defence of an organization an even bigger ask.
  In this talk we will cover how we can use Notebooks to help automate this task for us - from parsing reports, to extracting data of value, to validating it, and operationalizing it.
