  The talk is about our new book "Cybersecurity: data holds the answer" which has our latest findings in cybersecurity data science.
  The book contains a set of eight research projects, which seek to guide the reader on how to use artificial intelligence in defensive and offensive perspectives.
  On the defensive approximation, the book includes precise experiments to develop models for detecting malware on Android devices, cryptojacking, deepfakes, and malicious botnets.
  In the offensive approach, models for the generation of non-legitimate multimedia content are explored, and the concept of secure learning and the application of adversarial machine learning is introduced as an approach to find the values that allow biasing the results of a machine learning model.
  Each project was done using Jupyter notebooks and a research methodology that allows the person to replicate the results.
  Finally, the code and the results can be found in the next URL https://github.com/i2tResearch/Ciberseguridad_web
