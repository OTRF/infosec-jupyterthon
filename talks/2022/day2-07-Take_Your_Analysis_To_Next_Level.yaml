  Interactive dashboarding in Jupyter Notebook is a relatively new area.
  It makes data analysis interactive and easy even for people without the skills.
  Dashboarding libraries used to be relatively low-level and probably difficult for infosec people.
  However, with the recent developments in the area, there are new libraries that make dashboarding quite easy.
  In this talk, I will showcase hvPlot and Panel libraries and cover some potential use cases in security data analysis, threat hunting, and DFIR.
