      Dmitrijs come from Latvia, has ~10 years of experience in information security, works ar Sr. Software Engineer in Micorosft, but in past worked as Red Team Engineer and Security Data Scientist.
      Dmitrijs is pursuing his Ph.D. in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, and has two Master's Degrees.
      He has publications at DefCon AI Village, Black Hat USA and on scientific venues like CAMLIS and ACM CCS AISec, held membership in NATO CCDCOE cybersecurity events, certified: OSCP, SANS (GREM, GDAT), Stanford Online, etc. 
      More personal note: central free time dilemma is whether to beat deity AI in Civilization 6 or read Methods of Rationality (HPMOR) for the fourth time. But there is practically no free time since I am raising a 3-year-old neural network.

  In this talk, we will discuss techniques that can be used to efficiently model Linux auditd telemetry with machine learning techniques. We will investigate how security specialists can use execve process creation events with machine learning modeling to perform both (a) supervised malicious activity detection and (b) unsupervised baseline definition with consequent anomaly detection.
  We will evaluate different preprocessing methods like TF-IDF and hashing trick, as well as various machine learning models like gradient-boosted decision trees and isolation forest. Additionally, we will evaluate the adversarial robustness of such machine learning solutions for detection heuristics and consider how attackers may bypass these techniques.
