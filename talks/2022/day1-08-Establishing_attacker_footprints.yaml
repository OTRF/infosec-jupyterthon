  Microsoft Defender for Threat Intelligence, formerly RiskIQ, is a Threat Intelligence Engine that collects masses of data from the internet and crawls the internet to derive additional data creating a dense interconnected web of internet observations that can be used as signals in the art of threat intelligence, this gives the ability to see a lot of how the attacker operates.
  Investigations on this data are incredibly powerful allowing the discovery of infrastructure connections that could not have been seen or considered before.
  This visibility makes it harder for the attacker to go unidentified and theoretically making the playing field of the attacker bigger and the goal smaller!
  So how do you limit this scope and classify what belongs to an attacker or not? Especially when the attacker is using the same infrastructure that a normal company may use to support their needs. How do we make this large, interconnected web of threat intelligence actionable to an analyst?
  In this talk, we will present a notebook that address this challenge: Walking in the footsteps of attackers - Profiling compromised infrastructure using Machine Learning.
