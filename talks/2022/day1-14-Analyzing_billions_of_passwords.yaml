  Data breaches along with dump of sensitive information including passwords, social security and other business critical information is becoming norm in today`s digital world.
  This stolen information is often sold in underground community forums.
  This information can be further abused by the buyers in several forms such as buying goods with stolen credit card information, holding social media accounts data for ransom etc.
  In this presentation, we will take a look at old database dump of 1.4 billion clear text credentials which was compilation of several data breaches including sites such as yahoo.com, LinkedIn etc.
  The complete database is an archive of 41 GB with around 1980 files.
  We will take a look at how this dataset can be loaded for scalable data analysis using python and perform common data cleaning and preparation steps.
  We will then analyze the dataset to extract interesting insights and password trends.
  We will also visualize the summarized dataset.
  The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate how one can take real world large dataset, clean, enrich and perform data analysis at scale to extract interesting insights using Jupyter notebook.
