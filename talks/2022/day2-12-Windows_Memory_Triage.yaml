  Carrying out forensic analysis of memory images is a challenging task. Especially when you need enrichment inbuilt.
  A Jupyter notebook named "memOptix" https://github.com/blueteam0ps/memOptix was created so that triage can be carried out in a consistent manner.
  It also harnesses the power of msticpy for data enrichment and visualisation to aid the analysts.
