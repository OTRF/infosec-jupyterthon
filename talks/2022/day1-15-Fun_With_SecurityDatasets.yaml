  The Kestrel Threat Hunting Language provides a composable way for conceiving and sharing threat hunts. We will walk the audience through the procedure to create huntbooks in a public Kestrel cloud sandbox (binder environment) and conduct threat hunting on data from securitydatasets.com.
  In this session, we will first introduce the basic Kestrel concepts and how to use the Kestrel cloud sandbox.
  Then we will start a Jupyter notebook using the Kestrel language kernel and exercise the Kestrel PowerShell Deobfuscator using adversarial emulation logs from securitydatasets.com.
  We will hunt step-by-step and explain the analytics used in the hunt. Next, we will (maybe another huntbook?).
  Lastly, we will show how to integrate Kestrel into existing workflows by using its Python API in a Python notebook.
