  Threat Feeds can provide varied results for URLs and Domains, depending on who you're asking, Chosing the right threat feeds to integrate with products or for integrating with an existing vendor can be a tough choice to make, We made a databased analysis using open source threat feeds and how various vendor feeds compare with each other.
  Based on a hit rate and the size of samples a decision can be made for your specific use case.
  The power of Jupyter shines through this project because of the powerful data graphing and easy to use one-liners.
