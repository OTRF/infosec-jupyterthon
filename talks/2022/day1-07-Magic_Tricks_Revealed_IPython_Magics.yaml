  Jupyter notebooks support a feature called "magic commands" (aka "IPython magics") that use a special syntax (`%`) for calling utility functions.
  This talk explains how magics work and how to write custom magics that make security analysis and research tasks more efficient.
  The live demo is a proof-of-concept magic command that integrates the Azure CLI with `pandas` for convenient evidence collection and analysis in Jupyter notebooks. The PoC code will be open-sourced under the MIT license prior to the talk.
