An open community event for security researchers to share their experience and favorite [notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with the InfoSec community. We meet virtually, share notebooks, and have fun learning more about Jupyter notebooks applied to the InfoSec field. A great place to meet other Infosec [Jovyans!](#what-is-a-jovyan-ü™ê)

## What is a Jovyan ü™ê

You may see the word Jovyan used in Jupyter tools (such as the user ID in the Jupyter Docker stacks or referenced in conversations. But what is a Jovyan?

In astronomical terms, the word ‚ÄúJovian‚Äù means ‚Äúlike Jupiter‚Äù. It describes several planets that share Jupyter-like properties.

Much like the planet Jupiter and our solar system, the Jupyter community is large, distributed, and nebulous. We like to use the word Jovyan to describe members of this community. Jovyans are fellow open enthusiasts that use, develop, promote, teach, learn, and otherwise enjoy tools in Jupyter‚Äôs orbit. They make up the Jupyter community. If you‚Äôre not sure whether you‚Äôre a Jovyan, you probably are :-)
